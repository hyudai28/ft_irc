3.7.1 Kill message

      Command: KILL
   Parameters: <nickname> <comment>

	client-server間の接続をサーバーから切るコマンド
	サーバーはニックネーム衝突の際にKILLコマンドを使う
	オペレーターも使える

	クライアントがKILLメッセージの結果消去された場合、
	サーバーはunavailable nicknames listにニックネームを入れなければいけない
	コメントはKILLの原因を示す

   The KILL command is used to cause a client-server connection to be
   closed by the server which has the actual connection.  Servers
   generate KILL messages on nickname collisions.  It MAY also be
   available available to users who have the operator status.

   Clients which have automatic reconnect algorithms effectively make
   this command useless since the disconnection is only brief.  It does
   however break the flow of data and can be used to stop large amounts
   of 'flooding' from abusive users or accidents.  Abusive users usually
   don't care as they will reconnect promptly and resume their abusive
   behaviour.  To prevent this command from being abused, any user may
   elect to receive KILL messages generated for others to keep an 'eye'
   on would be trouble spots.

   In an arena where nicknames are REQUIRED to be globally unique at all
   times, KILL messages are sent whenever 'duplicates' are detected
   (that is an attempt to register two users with the same nickname) in
   the hope that both of them will disappear and only 1 reappear.

   When a client is removed as the result of a KILL message, the server
   SHOULD add the nickname to the list of unavailable nicknames in an
   attempt to avoid clients to reuse this name immediately which is
   usually the pattern of abusive behaviour often leading to useless
   "KILL loops".  See the "IRC Server Protocol" document [IRC-SERVER]
   for more information on this procedure.

   The comment given MUST reflect the actual reason for the KILL.  For
   server-generated KILLs it usually is made up of details concerning
   the origins of the two conflicting nicknames.  For users it is left
   up to them to provide an adequate reason to satisfy others who see
   it.  To prevent/discourage fake KILLs from being generated to hide
   the identify of the KILLer, the comment also shows a 'kill-path'
   which is updated by each server it passes through, each prepending
   its name to the path.

   NOTE:
   It is RECOMMENDED that only Operators be allowed to kill other users
   with KILL command.  This command has been the subject of many
   controversies over the years, and along with the above
   recommendation, it is also widely recognized that not even operators
   should be allowed to kill users on remote servers.
